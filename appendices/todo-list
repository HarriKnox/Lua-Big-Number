Modulus

Prime number stuff

String and file reading
   "Harrison is cool" -> {0x48617272, 0x69736f6e, 0x20697320, 0x636f6f6c})
                             H a r r     i s o n       i s       c o o l

Metatable

Proper encapsulation
   surprisingly, not all functions are supposed to be public

Immutability

Ratio and complex number module

Make it fast
   functional overhead for bitwise operations is high, but Lua 5.2 doesn't
   support bitwise sigils

Serializable magnitude/wordarray string

Number Namer

tostring to include separator and group size arguments

Add word-arrays to mutable functions
