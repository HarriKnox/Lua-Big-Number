Modulus

Prime number stuff

String and file reading
   "Harrison is cool" -> {0x48617272, 0x69736f6e, 0x20697320, 0x636f6f6c})
                             H a r r     i s o n       i s       c o o l

Metatable

Proper encapsulation
   surprisingly, not all functions are supposed to be public

Immutability

Ratio and complex number module

Make it fast
   functional overhead for bitwise operations is high, but Lua 5.2 doesn't
   support bitwise sigils

Serializable magnitude/wordarray string

Number Namer

tostring to include separator and group size arguments

Add word-arrays to mutable functions

Minimalist Biginteger / Simplify
   bigintegers can internally use references to other bigintegers or
   word-arrays to minimize memory usage at the cost of speed (needing to
   dereference the pointers), but will come with a `simplify` function that
   dereferences all pointers and converts the biginteger into a flat object.
