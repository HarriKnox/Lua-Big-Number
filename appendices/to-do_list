Modulus

Quick increment and decrement

Prime number stuff

Serializable magnitude/wordarray string

String and file reading
   "Harrison is cool" -> {0x48617272, 0x69736f6e, 0x20697320, 0x636f6f6c})
                             H a r r     i s o n       i s       c o o l

Metatable

Ratio and complex number module

Proper encapsulation
   surprisingly, not all functions are supposed to be public

Make it fast
   functional overhead for bitwise operations is high, but Lua 5.2 doesn't
   support bitwise sigils

Avoid checking validity of operable values twice in entry functions
   values are type checked twice in various entry functions: once in
      `assert(isvalidoperablevalue(value))`
   and the second time in
      `sign, mag = getsignandmagnitude(value)`

Immutability
