Modulus

Prime number stuff

Serializable magnitude/wordarray string

String and file reading
   "Harrison is cool" -> {0x48617272, 0x69736f6e, 0x20697320, 0x636f6f6c})
                             H a r r     i s o n       i s       c o o l

Metatable

Ratio and complex number module

Proper encapsulation
   surprisingly, not all functions are supposed to be public

Make it fast
   functional overhead for bitwise operations is high, but Lua 5.2 doesn't
   support bitwise sigils

Immutability

Number Namer

tostring to include separator and group size arguments

Add word-arrays to mutable functions
