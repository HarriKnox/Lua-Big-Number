To-do list:
 * GCD
 * modulus
 * quick increment and decrement
 * prime number stuff
 * serializable magnitude/wordarray string
 * string/file reading ("Harrison is cool" ->
                        {0x48617272, 0x69736f6e, 0x20697320, 0x636f6f6c})
 * metatable
 * ratio module
 * complex number module
 * proper encapsulation (surprisingly, not all functions
                         are supposed to be public)
 * make fast (functional overhead for bitwise operations is high,
              but Lua 5.2 doesn't support bitwise sigils)
